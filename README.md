Paper: MaxMin-L2-SVC-NCH: A Novel Approach for Support Vector Classifier Training and Parameter Selection

Overview
This Python code implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a modified optimization approach known as MaxMin-L2-SVC-NCH. 

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
Additional  SVMProj class (implemented in utils/SVMProj.py)

Datasets
Please uploa the data set in function load_data according to your needs.

SVM Model
The SVM model is implemented in the SVMProj class (implemented in utils/SVMProj.py). The main function contains methods for training and testing the model.
